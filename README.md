#A **C**omponent **OB**ject **SY**stem for Perl

---
Cobsy is a way to build and extend objects at runtime using components, which function like packages. A Cobsy component exports attributes and methods to add to a Cobsy
Object (a Cob). Cobsy can form the basis for a component entity system, or any other project without a clear object hierarchy where you want to avoid the rigidity of
standard class-based inheritance.
